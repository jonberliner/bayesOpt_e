        <p> To sample, you must click on the ground line where ever you think it will best help you find as deep an area as possible. </p>
        <p> <strong>To sample mineral line depth at a location, click the ground (tan stripe)</strong></p>
        <p> You can tell you can click becuse the ground will glow when you hover your mouse over it.</p>
        <p> Note that it will cost a significant amount of money to drill at each location once the crew arrives,
            so be sure to choose where to sample wisely! </p>
